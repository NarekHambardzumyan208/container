Binary Tree Implementation README
Introduction
This is a C++ implementation of a binary tree data structure. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Features
Binary Tree Structure: The implementation represents a binary tree using nodes, with each node having left and right children.

Traversal Methods: The class provides methods for performing three common tree traversal operations: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

Layer-wise Printing: You can print the tree layer by layer using a queue-based approach.

Usage
To use this Binary Tree class in your C++ project, follow these steps:

Include the necessary header file in your C++ code:

cpp
Copy code
#include "BinaryTree.h" // Include the Binary Tree class implementation
Create a Binary Tree object:

cpp
Copy code
BinaryTree binaryTree;
Initialize the tree with nodes as needed. You can use the init() method to create a sample binary tree.

cpp
Copy code
binaryTree.init();
Perform operations on the Binary Tree as needed. Here are some examples:

Print the tree layer by layer:

cpp
Copy code
binaryTree.PrintLayers();
Print the tree using pre-order traversal:

cpp
Copy code
binaryTree.PrintPreOrder();
Print the tree using in-order traversal:

cpp
Copy code
binaryTree.PrintInOrder();
Print the tree using post-order traversal:

cpp
Copy code
binaryTree.PrintPostOrder();
Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the Binary Tree:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include "BinaryTree.h"

int main() {
    BinaryTree binaryTree;
    binaryTree.init();

    std::cout << "Layer-wise printing: ";
    binaryTree.PrintLayers();
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Pre-order traversal: ";
    binaryTree.PrintPreOrder();
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    binaryTree.PrintInOrder();
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Post-order traversal: ";
    binaryTree.PrintPostOrder();
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
