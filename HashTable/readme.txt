HashTable Implementation README
Introduction
This is a C++ implementation of a HashTable data structure, designed to store key-value pairs, with a focus on flexibility and efficiency. The HashTable is implemented using an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list of key-value pairs.

Features
Template-based: The HashTable is implemented as a template class, allowing you to store key-value pairs of any data type.

Dynamic Capacity: You can specify the initial capacity of the HashTable upon creation, and it will automatically resize when needed to accommodate more data.

Hash Function: The HashTable uses a hash function to compute the index where each key-value pair should be stored, providing fast retrieval times.

Usage
To use this HashTable in your C++ project, follow these steps:

Include the necessary header files in your C++ code:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include "Includes/vector.h" // Include your vector implementation
#include "Includes/List.h"   // Include your list implementation
#include "HashTable.h"       // Include the HashTable implementation
Create a HashTable object:

cpp
Copy code
HashTable<KeyType, ValueType> hashTable;
Insert key-value pairs into the HashTable:

cpp
Copy code
KeyType key = /* your key */;
ValueType value = /* your value */;
hashTable.insert(key, value);
Retrieve values from the HashTable using keys:

cpp
Copy code
KeyType searchKey = /* key to search for */;
ValueType foundValue;

if (hashTable.find(searchKey, foundValue)) {
    // Key found, and foundValue contains the associated value.
} else {
    // Key not found.
}
Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the HashTable:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include "Includes/vector.h"
#include "Includes/List.h"
#include "HashTable.h"

int main() {
    // Create a HashTable with an initial capacity of 100.
    HashTable<std::string, int> hashTable(100);

    // Insert key-value pairs.
    hashTable.insert("Alice", 25);
    hashTable.insert("Bob", 30);
    hashTable.insert("Charlie", 40);

    // Retrieve values.
    int age;
    if (hashTable.find("Bob", age)) {
        std::cout << "Bob's age is " << age << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Bob not found in the HashTable." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
